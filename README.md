Apostol Core
-
Core files for building projects based on platforms:
- [Apostol](https://github.com/apostoldevel/apostol);
- [Apostol](https://github.com/apostoldevel/apostol) + [db-platform](https://github.com/apostoldevel/db-platform) (**Apostol CRM**).

> **Apostol CRM** is not a standalone product. It is an abstract name for the combination of the [Apostol](https://github.com/apostoldevel/apostol) C++ application server framework and [db-platform](https://github.com/apostoldevel/db-platform) — a PostgreSQL Framework for Backend Development — used together via purpose-built modules and processes. Each framework can be used independently; together they form a full-stack backend platform.
